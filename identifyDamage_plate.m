function [x,itn] = oneProjector(b,d,tau)
% ONEPROJECTOR  Projects b onto the weighted one-norm ball of radius tau
%
%    [X,ITN] = ONEPROJECTOR(B,TAU) returns the orthogonal projection
%    of the vector b onto the one-norm ball of radius tau. The return
%    vector X which solves the problem
%
%            minimize  ||b-x||_2  st  ||x||_1 <= tau.

%               x
%
%    If D is empty, all weights are set to one, i.e., D = I.
%
%    In both cases, the return value ITN given the number of elements
%    of B that were thresholded.
