# CrackDetection
This is a dictionary based method to detect cracks and loads on beems, truss and  plates. This uses compressed accelerometer responses for the dictionary and uses COMPRESSIVE SENSING to compress and extract the data.
This project also contain code to compare various compressive sensing algorithms.
